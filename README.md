# Stable Diffusion implementation

This project aims to create a custom implementation of the stable diffusion technique for generating high-quality images from text prompts. Stable Diffusion is a generative model that iteratively refines noise into a coherent image based on the given text input.

## Implemented Components

- ✅ **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**
- ✅ **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)**
- ✅ **Attention Mechanism**
- ✅ **Time Embedding**
- ✅ **Attention UNet** is in progress
- ❌ **Denoising Algorithm**
- ❌ **Full Pipeline**
